# Amit Tauro

I studied at Makers Academy Part-Time Course from July 2020 to January 2021 understanding the core principles of the most popular programming languages and cementing best processes and practices. My goal is to work at a company where I can continue to both improve and diversify the skillset that I developed at Makers, as well as using the transferable engineering skills I have gained in previous roles.

## Skills

#### *Problem Solving*
I love problem solving efficiently. I recently identified the root-cause to a complex chemical problem that improved production times by 20%. I thoroughly enjoy solving code katas and take great satisfaction from solving problems on Codewars and Leetcode.
#### *Eager Learner*
I love reflecting and improving. It might be writing cleaner code or finding better ways to communicate amongst team members. Challenges provide me with opportunities to learn and I relish the ensuing growth. I continue to challenge myself by learning new languages including React.  
#### *Teamwork*
I thrive off working with others to come up with improved ideas and solutions. I have been able to develop this skill through regular pairing at Makers. I am a Senior Engineer managing four Junior Engineers. I lead projects and provide every individual with clear goals that are broken down into manageable deliverables.
